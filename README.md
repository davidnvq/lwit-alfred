# Look Wide Interpret Twice: Improving Performance on Interactive Instruction-following Tasks
We present a method for the ALFRED benchmark which won the ECCV Challenge 2020.
The model based on a single view achieved 4.45% success rate on unseen environment (further improved to 8.37% with multiple views).
